## Methodologies & Concepts

I utilize a variety of computational approaches to extract biological meaning from raw sequencing data.

### Differential Gene Expression (DGE)
Identifying significant transcriptional changes between leukemia subtypes. I use **DESeq2** and **edgeR** to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that serve as potential biomarkers.

### WGCNA Network Analysis
Beyond single genes, I analyze gene networks to find clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes. This helps in identifying "hub genes" that drive specific cancer phenotypes.

## Current Projects

### Transcriptomic Landscape of Indian B-ALL
* **Objective:** To characterize the genetic profile of B-ALL in the Indian population using RNA-Seq.
* **Role:** Lead researcher; performed QC, alignment, fusion calling, and downstream statistical analysis.
* **Outcome:** Identified novel fusion partners and subtype-specific expression signatures.

### Profiling of predictive & prognostic molecular genetic aberrations in BCR::ABL1 negative B-ALL
* **Objective:** To identify relevant pathways & genes which are dysregulated in high risk B-ALL and drug repurposing or docking for the potential candidates.
* **Role:** Lead researcher; performed all the experiments and analysis.
* **Outcome:** Identified prognostic biomarkers and drug candidates.
