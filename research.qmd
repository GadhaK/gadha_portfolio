## Methodologies & Concepts

I utilize a variety of computational approaches to extract biological meaning from raw sequencing data.

### Differential Gene Expression (DGE)
Identifying significant transcriptional changes between leukemia subtypes is central to my work. I use **DESeq2** and **edgeR** to isolate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that serve as potential biomarkers.

### WGCNA Network Analysis
Beyond single genes, I analyze gene networks to find clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes. This helps in identifying "hub genes" that drive specific cancer phenotypes.

## Current Projects

### 1. Transcriptomic Landscape of Indian B-ALL
* **Objective:** To characterize the genetic profile of B-ALL in the Indian population using RNA-Seq.
* **Role:** Lead researcher; performed QC, alignment, fusion calling, and downstream statistical analysis.
* **Outcome:** Identified novel fusion partners and subtype-specific expression signatures.

### 2. Predictive Modeling for High-Risk Leukemia
* **Objective:** Developing a classifier to stratify patients into risk groups based on gene expression.
* **Tools:** R (Caret, RandomForest), Survival Analysis.
