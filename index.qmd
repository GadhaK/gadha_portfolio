I am a **Ph.D. Scholar** in Cancer Genetics at **AIIMS, New Delhi**, working at the intersection of molecular genetics and bioinformatics.

## Research Focus

My research investigates the molecular landscape of **B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL)**. I specialize in identifying predictive biomarkers and novel fusions in BCR::ABL1-negative B-ALL to drive personalized medicine approaches.

## Current Work

-   **Genomic Profiling:** Investigating genetic subtypes and fusions in B-ALL using RNA-Seq and functional assays.
-   **Drug Targets:** Studying predictive and prognostic molecular aberrations to improve patient outcomes.
