## About Me

I am a **PhD Scholar** at the **All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)**, New Delhi, operating at the intersection of **Molecular Biology** and **Bioinformatics**.

With a strong foundation in bench-based cancer research, I have pivoted to computational biology—and I am loving every minute of it. My current work integrates **transcriptomics (RNA-Seq)**, machine learning, and clinical data to decipher the molecular landscape of **B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL)**.

I am analyzing expression-based RNA-Seq data from a large **Indian B-ALL cohort** to reveal subtype-specific expression patterns, fusion events, and transcriptomic profiles. My ultimate goal is to uncover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that can improve treatment strategies.

I am actively seeking **Postdoctoral opportunities** in genomics and data-driven biology to further explore how code can solve real-world biological problems.
